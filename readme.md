# Job Management System Backend

This is the backend API for the job management system, built with Flask. It provides endpoints for managing job records.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jsoke18/adhome-backend.git
```
2. Install backend dependencies: 

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Start the backend server: 

```bash
python app.py
```

## API Documentation
The backend API provides the following endpoints:

- `GET /jobs`: Retrieve a list of all job records.
- `GET /jobs/{id}`: Retrieve a specific job record by its ID.
- `POST /jobs`: Create a new job record.
- `PUT /jobs/{id}`: Update an existing job record.
- `DELETE /jobs/{id}`: Delete a job record.

### Request and Response Formats
- Request bodies should be in JSON format.
- Response bodies will be in JSON format.

### Error Handling
- If a request is invalid or cannot be processed, the API will return an appropriate HTTP status code along with an error message in the response body.

## Architecture
- The Flask application defines the API routes and their respective handler functions in the app.py file, where the business logic for managing job data is implemented.
- Jobs data is stored in a JSON file (`data/jobs.json`).
- JSON data is loaded and saved using the `json` module.

## Libraries
The backend utilizes the following libraries and frameworks:

- Flask: A lightweight web framework for building the backend API.
- Flask-CORS: A Flask extension for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

## Architecture and Design Choices

### Flask Framework
Flask was chosen for its lightweight and modular nature, making it easy to customize and extend as needed for this small project.

### Flask-CORS
The [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) extension handles Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), allowing the backend API to be accessed from the front-end web application. 

### Directory Structure

The backend directory structure is organized as follows:

ðŸ“‚ADHOME-BACKEND
 â”£ ðŸ“‚data
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œjobs.json
 â”ƒ   # This file contains the job data in JSON format.
 â”£ ðŸ“œ.gitattributes
 â”ƒ # This file specifies attributes per path.
 â”£ ðŸ“œapp.py
 â”ƒ # This file contains the main Flask application code.
 â”£ ðŸ“œREADME.md
 â”ƒ # This file contains the documentation and instructions for the backend.
 â”— ðŸ“œrequirements.txt
   # This file lists the Python dependencies required for the backend.
